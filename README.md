# Schedule-Algorithms

A process scheduling simulator for operating systems. Allows loading processes from a file, adding new processes, viewing them, and running scheduling algorithms.

## Features
- Load processes from a file (`process.txt`).
- Add processes manually.
- View loaded processes.
- Scheduling algorithms:
  - FCFS (First Come, First Served)
  - SJF (Shortest Job First)
  - Priority
  - Round Robin

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
- Load processes: Option 1.
- Add process: Option 2.
- View processes: Option 3.
- Schedule: Option 4 (choose algorithm).
